# Browser Parking Lot

The aim of this project is to create a system for organizing and prioritizing valuable links along with associated to-do items, categorized by priority labels such as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

Each entry includes:

- Date of creation
- A hyperlink
- A concise text description
- Priority label (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

The Browser Parking Lot serves as a solution to declutter your browser tabs, leading to reduced computer memory consumption. This approach is more efficient than utilizing the browser itself as a to-do list.
